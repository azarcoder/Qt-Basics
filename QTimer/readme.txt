QTimer is a class in the Qt framework that provides a high-level programming interface for timers. It can be used to create both repetitive and single-shot timers.

Repetitive timers emit the timeout() signal at a specified interval. This signal can be connected to a slot in order to perform an action when the timer times out. For example, a repetitive timer could be used to update a progress bar or to animate a sprite.

Single-shot timers emit the timeout() signal only once. They can be used to delay the execution of a slot until after a certain amount of time has elapsed. For example, a single-shot timer could be used to display a message box after a user has clicked a button.

To use QTimer, you first create a QTimer object and specify the desired interval or timeout. Then, you connect the timeout() signal to a slot in order to perform an action when the timer times out. Finally, you call the start() method to start the timer.
